        Chicken shawarma is a Middle Eastern dish made with marinated chicken, wrapped in a soft pita bread and filled with various vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. 
        The chicken is typically seasoned with a blend of flavorful spices, including cumin, paprika, and turmeric, and then grilled or roasted to tender perfection. 
        The dish is often served with a variety of sauces, such as garlic yogurt sauce or tahini sauce, to add a delicious tangy and creamy flavor to the wrap. 
        Chicken shawarma is a popular street food in many countries and is loved for its bold and delicious taste.
